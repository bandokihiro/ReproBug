How to use code:

1) Edit configure.sh with the locations of legion, metis, and hdf5

2) Edit configure.sh and set the build type (release or debug)

2) Create a build directory

3) Run configure.sh in the build directory

4) compile the code with make install

5) Run the executable in the test directory with 
    ../exec -ll:cpu 1

6) input.toml can be edited to change the number of partitions or the mesh.

Issues:
- The code stalls in the SolutionData::compute_error function in solution_data.cpp during the line f.get_result<rtype>() at a random iteration.
- This stall always occurs on the last subregion.
- I haven't been able to reproduce the stall in debug mode.
